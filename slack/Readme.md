}

action "Build" {

}

action "Deploy" {

  uses = "apex/actions/up@master"
  secrets = ["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"]
  args = "deploy production"
}

action "Deploy Notification" {
  needs = "Deploy"
  uses = "apex/actions/slack@master"
  secrets = ["DEPLOY_NOTIFY_SLACK_URL"]
}
```
